# Bot Showcase

This repository holds a selection of cogs and utilities I've written for the [discord.py](https://github.com/rapptz/discord.py) framework.
You are free to suggest changes by raising issues, or improve the code by making pull requests.

## The intent

The intent of creating this public repository was to encourage developers to create unique features similar to this, rather than have every bot copy each other.
These cogs may be used as specified under "[Using this code](#Using-this-code)"
